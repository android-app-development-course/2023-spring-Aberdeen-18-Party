## Party APP Business Plan
### 1.APP introduction
Party is an open mobile social application that provides college students with a multi-directional and scenario-based social experience.
Here, you can make like-minded friends anytime and anywhere, meet the library or the basketball court, or a want to leave the party, discover the beautiful life around you. We encourage you to become good friends with strangers and explore and create a wonderful life around you together.
* Recruit partners: Freely select sections (social, sports, learning, entertainment, travel) and post recruitment, here you can also customize the people who can participate (gender, age...) And help you make new friends.
* Party scoring: After the event, you can post scoring posts to share this trip, and users with good evaluation will be rated as quality users.
### 2. Target users
We developed this app to help college students quickly recruit partners and make more friends. Many college students today miss many wonderful activities or opportunities to improve themselves because of shyness, or because they can't find their own ball friends, dinner partners, study partners and worry. Our Party APP was created for that.
### 3. Sales proposition
Our app is designed for college students who are struggling to find a ball friend, a meal partner, a study partner, or a friend for entertainment. What they need most is timeliness, customizability, and security. Our sales proposition is based on the following key characteristics:
* Timeliness: At present, the way you want to recruit activity partners is basically the circle of friends and this information is only transmitted between people you know. Our app can help you publish your "party" needs in real time, so that your recruitment information is no longer submerged in the vast circle of friends, and can let more people you know and don't know see.
* Customizability: Here you can freely choose the gender, age, etc., you want to recruit partners, limited recruitment will no longer appear in everyone's interface. Let the user have more choice space.
* Security: As a campus recruitment platform app, we fully consider its necessary security. In order to ensure the authenticity of the user's registered identity, we will adopt real-name registration (ID card, campus card). At the same time, we have a shielding function, reporting system, when you encounter a repeatedly violated platform regulations (late, disorderly report) you can choose to block the user or report.
### 4. Marketing channels
In order to let more people use this app, and let this app really help you, we decided to take the following three channels to promote:
* Circle of friends promotion: Through the circle of friends promotion, let more people know the existence of this software.
* Offline sales: stalls on campus and door-to-door promotions in various dormitories can be implemented.
* Online advertising: We will put our ads in the major search engines to improve its keyword search priority, so that more people know about the existence of this software.
5. Financial analysis
Our goal is a completely free APP, we want to give the user the best experience. Our future profit model will be to accumulate a large user base to attract paid advertisements from major advertisers, so as to pay for all the expenses in the early stage. Our initial goal is to reach 500 users on campus, increasing the number of users through trial and error, correction and then scaling up the promotion. As the product matures, we hope to reach a user base of 3w and above and have a daily active capacity of 5,000 to 10,000.
